# String compression with pointers and position numeral system conversion

My submition for a homework project in my 1st semester Programming 101 at the Department of Information Systems at the University of Haifa.

**My code has been graded 100/100.**

It demonstrates usage of pointers in the C programming language. 

The code itself is within the .c file, with a precompiled executable also available alongside. Hebrew instructions are included in the pdf document.
