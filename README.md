# C Pointers - Examples of string compression and positional numeral systems conversion
My submition for a homework project in my 1st semester Programming 101 at the Department of Information Systems at the University of Haifa.
The first function compresses a given string according to the algorithm specified in the instructions, while the second function converts a base 10 integer to a specified positional base b numeral system.

**My code has been graded 100/100.**

It demonstrates usage of pointers in the C programming language. 

The code itself is within the .c file, with a precompiled executable also available alongside. Hebrew instructions are included in the pdf document.
